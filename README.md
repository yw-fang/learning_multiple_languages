# learning_multiple_languages

## Introduction

I learnt some basic Deutsch and Japanese several years ago, however,
the memory of Japanese has almost gone with the wind.

I came back to Japan in 2017 for further widening and deepening my research
in materials science. This hadn't been long since I left Nagoya for Shanghai in November, 2016.

I decided to learn Japanese again to better enjoy the research and life here.
For myself, Japanese sounds very cute (かわい) and interesting. I like it very much.
I also read a lot of books about Japanese culture and detective stories
in the past ten years although they
were all translated or written in English or Chinese.

Although this repository will cover several different languages, I will focus on
Japanese in 2018. To make it appealing to my self, I will also cross-discuss my mother languae--Chinese,
my second language--English, and Deutsch.
